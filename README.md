# YourWay

## General info âœ”
   Achieving the success is that we are all dreaming. Everyone has different definition of success - one wants to go to the dream work, other is about to start his own business.      What should I do to pursue my dreams? These and other questions will be answered by our guests who will share their knowledge in the YourWay program.
   The project was created as part of the project in the contest [zwolnieni z teorii](https://zwolnienizteorii.pl).
